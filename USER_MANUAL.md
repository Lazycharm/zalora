  - **Login as user** — Impersonate that user: your session is replaced by theirs, and you are redirected to the store home. Use this to see the store as that user (e.g. for support or testing). To return to admin, log out and log in again with your admin account.
  - **View shop** — If the user has a shop, open that shop’s admin page (`/admin/shops/[id]`).
  - **Delete user** — Permanently delete the user (confirm in dialog). Use with care.

## 16. Settings
